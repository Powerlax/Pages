		<article id="deepfakeresearchTitle">Deepfake Detection Research</article>
		<p id="deepfakeresearchPara">I have recently finished my most recent research project, titled "Unveiling Truth Through Gestures: A Multimodal Deepfake Detection System," where I use multimodal information such as gestures and artifacts to detect a deepfake. This is currently in the process of being published in the Princeton Journal of Interdisciplinary Research and has been accepted to the international ALLEGET conference.</p>

		<article id="crossingresearchTitle">Visually Impaired Aid</article>
		<p id="crossingresearchPara">A while back, I worked on a computer vision based system to make street crossings safer for the visually impaired by building a device that used object detection and depth estimation to detect if any oncoming traffic would hit a visually impaired person. This paper won 5th in the state at the Washington JSHS conference. I also got the oppurunity to present this at the international level. You can read the paper <a class="link" href="https://jhss.scholasticahq.com/article/118762" target="_blank" class="link">here.</a> </p>

		<article id="pianoCoversTitle">Piano Covers</article>
		<p id="pianoCoverPara">I love to play the piano! I have been playing the piano for 7 years now and I loved every moment of it. Although my piano teacher gives me many songs to work on, I love to challenge myself by recreating some of my favorite songs into piano covers!
